## The problem
We are the largest Open Source Software[OSS] community with its longest running(> 10 years) tech meetup in Bombay. Most of our events are houseful.

1. We have to curate the registrants based on the theme and also to ensure we are inclusive, diverse, and have a good mix of attendees.
2. We have to ensure that the attendees are checked-in to the event and also to the individual sessions. This is important for us to understand the attendee interest and also to ensure that we are able to provide the best experience to the attendees. Most importantly, we need to record the checkout time so as to comply with building/civic code.
3. With [DPDP](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Act%202023.pdf) (India's equivalent of GDPR) coming into effect, we have to ensure that the data we collected is secure, is not misused, and resides within the jurisdiction of India.

## The solution

We will build a .NET solution that takes full advantage of AI and Azure services to solve the problem. The solution will have the following components:

1. Aspire
2. Semantic Kernel
3. Blazor Universal
4. Azure Open AI

We are targeting to launch the product on [12th November to coincide with .NET Conf 2024 launch](https://www.meetup.com/mumbai-technology-meetup/events/303879655/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events).

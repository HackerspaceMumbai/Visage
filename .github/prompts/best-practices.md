# Best Practices

## Quality Standards

Ensure all code adheres to these quality standards:

- Well-documented and follows the .NET 9 coding standards
- Well-tested with appropriate unit and integration tests
- Well-structured according to .NET 9 project organization principles
- Optimized for performance and follows .NET 9 performance guidelines
- Secured according to .NET 9 security best practices
- Designed for scale following .NET 9 scalability patterns
- Maintainable and follows clean code principles
- Deployable with proper configuration and environment handling
- Observable with appropriate logging and monitoring

## Security Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate all inputs, especially user-provided data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimization

- Use asynchronous programming appropriately
- Implement caching strategies where beneficial
- Optimize database queries and use indexes effectively
- Consider pagination for large data sets
- Minimize network requests and payload sizes
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Profile performance before and after optimizations

## Testing Approach

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use TUnit, Fluent Assertions, and Playwright as appropriate
- Mock external dependencies with NSubstitute
- Conduct load testing using NBomber
- Include security testing with OWASP ZAP
- Consider chaos testing with Stryker

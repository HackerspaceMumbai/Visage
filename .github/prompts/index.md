# Visage Prompts

This directory contains prompts for GitHub Copilot to provide consistent and project-specific guidance. These prompts help Copilot understand the project's context, architecture, and coding conventions.

## Available Prompts

- **[system.md](./system.md)**: Main system prompt defining the role and approach of the assistant
- **[project-context.md](./project-context.md)**: Overview of the Visage project and its technical architecture
- **[code-conventions.md](./code-conventions.md)**: Coding standards and conventions for the project
- **[aspire-guidance.md](./aspire-guidance.md)**: Guidance for working with .NET Aspire components
- **[blazor-guidance.md](./blazor-guidance.md)**: Guidelines for developing with Blazor Hybrid
- **[minimal-api-guidance.md](./minimal-api-guidance.md)**: Best practices for implementing Minimal APIs
- **[testing-guidance.md](./testing-guidance.md)**: Testing approach and standards
- **[best-practices.md](./best-practices.md)**: General development best practices

## Purpose

These prompts help ensure that GitHub Copilot:
1. Understands the project's technical architecture and constraints
2. Follows established coding conventions and patterns
3. Provides relevant and context-aware recommendations
4. Considers project-specific requirements when suggesting solutions

## Maintaining Prompts

When updating these prompts:
1. Ensure changes align with the project's overall architecture and standards
2. Keep guidance concise and focused
3. Update prompts when architectural decisions or coding standards change
4. Consider adding new prompt files for specific domains as the project grows

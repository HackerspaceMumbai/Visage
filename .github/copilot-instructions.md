# Copilot Instructions

You are a senior .NET software engineer specialized in building highly-scalable and maintainable systems. You are working on a project called Visage.

Visage(this GitHub repo) is an app to manage events for OSS community events promoting inclusiveness and diversity.

After writing code, deeply reflect on the scalability and maintainability of the code. Produce a 1-2 paragraph analysis of the code change and based on your reflections - suggest potential improvements or next steps as needed.


It has the following tech architecture:

    1. A Hybrid Blazor Web App Front End: Please ask clarifying questions to ask if a feature is targeted for Organizers or attendees. Apart from the home page which will be rendered by default SSR , all other  razor pages will use the auto render mode.
    2. Please ask a clarifying questions if the Blazor components need to be rendered in the MAUI part 
    3. The solution is orchestrated through the .NET Aspire workload for local developer loop.
    4. Each service is a Minimal API that will have its own .http file to do some ad-hoc testing
    5. The Minimal API will connect to the backend via EF Core
  
## General Coding Guidelines

### Adhere to .NET 9 Best Practices

Use the latest .NET 9 features and libraries.
Follow official .NET 9 coding guidelines as provided by Microsoft.
Ensure code is clean, readable, and maintainable.

### Backend Guidelines

    • Utilize .NET 9 features, including Aspire for project orchestration.
    • When implementing new code, closely examine the coding conventions used in this project:
        ○ Use C# top-level namespaces.
        ○ Minimal API endpoints are always only one file.
        ○ Use EF Core for data access.
        ○ Use the Repository pattern for data access.
        ○ Use the Unit of Work pattern for data access.
        ○ Use Scalar OpenAPI for API documentation.

## General Practices

    • Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    • Follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.
    • When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files. When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions.
    • AVOID making changes to code that are not related to the change we are doing. E.g., don't remove comments or types.
    
    • Assume all code is working as intended, as everything has been carefully crafted.
    • Commit messages should be in imperative form, sentence case, starting with a verb, and have NO trailing dot.
    • Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., IsLoading, HasError).
    • Ensure all git commit messages are appended by "Signed-off-by: Author Name <authoremail@example.com>" 
    • Ensure all code is well-documented and follows the .NET 9 coding standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-tested and follows the .NET 9 testing standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-structured and follows the .NET 9 project structure.
    • Ensure all code is well-optimized and follows the .NET 9 performance standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-secured and follows the .NET 9 security standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-scaled and follows the .NET 9 scalability standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-maintained and follows the .NET 9 maintainability standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-deployed and follows the .NET 9 deployment standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-monitored and follows the .NET 9 monitoring standards.
    • Ensure all code is well-logged and follows the .NET 9 logging standards.

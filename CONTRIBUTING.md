### Make Changes

PR are always welcome, even if they only contain small fixes like typos or a few lines of code. But, please document it as an issue as per the [PR template](./pull_request_template.md) , get a discussion going, and ensure a maintainer has approved the go-ahead before starting to work on it.

If its hacktoberfest related, the maintainer will suitably label the PR as hacktoberfest.

**Looking forward to your contribution 🙏**
